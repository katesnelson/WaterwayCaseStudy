# WaterwayCaseStudy

This repo holds agent-based model (ABM) code (in Netlogo) and R scripts for model calibration and validation, AIS data processing, and analysis of case study simulations of the inland waterway tow traffic in the context of extreme weather events simulation described in ["Agent-Based Model of Navigable Inland Waterway Tow Operation Procedures."](https://doi.org/10.3141/2611-02)

Code included was used in the validation of the ABM for the Ohio River using 2013 and 2014 barge AIS data and to analyze the simulated operational impacts of a waterway incident and potential waterway management alternatives. These analyses are described in ["Utilizing agent-based modeling to evaluate operational impacts of an incident and possible alternatives on US waterways."](https://doi.org/10.1177/0361198120941504)
